## Project Description
This Next.js application utilizes the Police API to retrieve data and generate statistics based on longitude and latitude inputs. It features two main pages— one for searching by coordinates (lat/lng) and another for searching by a specific police force. The latter includes a dynamically generated list of police forces, a caching mechanism and dynamic routing implementation to provide a more detailed look at the data from the api. 

## Updates for Consideration
1.Enhanced Statistics: Introduce additional statistical features for a more comprehensive analysis.
Implement dynamic charting to visualize trends over time.

2.Improved User Experience: Enhance the user interface for better accessibility and user engagement.
Consider interactive maps for a more intuitive experience when searching by coordinates.
