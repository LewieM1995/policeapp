## Project Description
This Next.js application utilizes the Police API to retrieve data and generate statistics based on longitude and latitude inputs. It features two main pagesâ€”one for searching by coordinates (lat/lng) and another for searching by a specific police force. The latter includes a dynamically generated list of police forces from the API, allowing users to visualize the full data object, not just a snippet. This is achieved by caching the data when user requests data from the api.

## Updates for Consideration
1.Enhanced Statistics: Introduce additional statistical features for a more comprehensive analysis.
Implement dynamic charting to visualize trends over time.

2.Improved User Experience: Enhance the user interface for better accessibility and user engagement.
Consider interactive maps for a more intuitive experience when searching by coordinates.
